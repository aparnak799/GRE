The argument made by the television station states that since they began allotting lesser time to local news and weather, and focused more on national news, they have received negative responses from their viewers and have lost advertiser revenue. Hence, they propose that they bring back their original schedule for weather and local news so as to appease the viewers and avoid losing more advertisers.

This is a well-constructed argument with supporting evidence. It is clear that there is a proper negative correlation between lesser time devoted to local news and weather and viewer satisfaction. This claim can be strengthened by assuming that most of these viewers belong to the local population. This is further asserted by the fact that locals may want to know the weather conditions in their locality.

Consequently, based on the first assumption that most people are locals, due to lower broadcast time for weather and local news, if they do not watch this particular news broadcast, they evidently do not watch the advertisements on that program. This leads to heavy losses incurred by the advertising brands, which inevitably leads to them pulling out of the channel. Thus, the claim that advertisers outright terminated their contracts is also supported by evidence.

Thus, the television company's decision to bring back the airing time for local news and weather is a warranted decision, and will help restore advertiser revenue and increase viewer satisfaction.
